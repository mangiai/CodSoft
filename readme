**Machine Learning Internship Projects at CodSoft**
This document describes three machine learning projects I completed during a virtual internship at CodSoft. These projects showcase various techniques for data analysis, model building, and evaluation using popular Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (Sklearn), Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-plot (for ROC Curves), and more.

1. Movie Genre Classification

In this project, I built a model to predict movie genres based on textual data, such as plot summaries or descriptions. Here's the breakdown:

Data Exploration: I explored a movie dataset to understand the distribution of genres and identify any text pre-processing needs.
Feature Engineering: Textual features were extracted from the descriptions, potentially including techniques like tokenization, stop-word removal, and n-grams.
Model Building and Evaluation: I trained and evaluated various machine learning models, like Support Vector Machines (SVM) or Logistic Regression, to classify movies into their respective genres. Performance was assessed using metrics like accuracy and ROC curves.
2. Customer Churn Prediction

This project focused on predicting customer churn for a subscription-based service. The goal was to identify customers at risk of canceling their subscriptions.

Data Exploration: I analyzed customer data to understand factors influencing churn, such as demographics, subscription plans, and past usage patterns.
Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning and feature engineering might have been involved to prepare the data for modeling.
Model Building and Evaluation: I built models (potentially using techniques like Logistic Regression) to predict churn probability for individual customers. Model performance was evaluated using metrics relevant to the business case, such as precision, recall, or F1 score.
3. Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project aimed to develop a system for detecting fraudulent credit card transactions in real-time.

Data Exploration: I explored historical transaction data to understand patterns of legitimate and fraudulent transactions.
Feature Engineering: Features were likely extracted to capture transaction characteristics, such as amount, location, time, and past spending behavior.
Model Building and Evaluation: I trained classification models (potentially using techniques like Random Forest or Isolation Forest) to identify fraudulent transactions. Model performance was evaluated using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall, considering the trade-off between catching fraud and minimizing false positives.
These projects demonstrate the application of machine learning techniques for real-world problems. By exploring data, building models, and evaluating their performance, I gained valuable experience in the machine learning lifecycle.
